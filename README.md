Welcome Craigharrison79,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!

# Design Smile

For my first milestone project I have to build a static responsive front end website as part of my Diploma Course with the Code Institute.
I wanted to build a website of a family member who wanted to advertise her business through the Covid-19 times and beyond.

## Strategy

I sat down with the business owner and talk about her ideas of the website and the information to be display on the site.  This information is below in the goal section.  
Then I put myself in the potential customer view and wrote down a list of thing I would be looking for on visiting a dentist website.  I also ask a few friend and work
colleagues on there input as potential customer, again information list below.  With all this information I start to work on some different wireframes on paper.

## Goals

### Owner Stories:

The owner want a clean and easy to read website that is useable of young and old clients. She feel the colour pattern should be a shadow of blue as this represent the heath 
service community best. See colour scheme for more details.

#### Owner Goals:

Increase new clients to the business.
Help spread brand awareness.
Increase social following.
To pervert service information.
Pervert location and navigation to the clinic.
Pervert a way of potential and old client contact her.

### User Stories:

A user would split into two main types - Someone  who is looking a dentist and an existincustomer.  

New Customer is then break down into two categories - new to the area or need help with an issue.

#### New Customer Goals:

    *Need Help*

        To get hold of someone fast on the phone.
		Which service you provide.
		Testimonial and show of work.

	*Move to the area*

		Location of a client (close to home or work).
		Which service you provide.
		Testimonial and show of work.
		Contact point.
		How the clinic looks.

#### Existing Customer Goals:

	Need contact information to check appointment or cancel.
	Find out the address or location (maybe the second visit).
	Book an appointment
	Maybe link to any information site eg surgeons or insurance/government protocols on payment.

## Design

### Wireframes

After finish my drawing on paper, I use mockup (https://www.mockflow.com/) on design the overall idea.  Link below to the design.
(assets)link here.

### Typography

I need to have a readable font of anyone to read. Some thing with clean lines and open and not to forcefully.  I pick ‘Roboto’ for my headings and then ‘Poppins’ of everything else.  Both have nice flowing lines and go well together.   I using Google Fonts (Link)
(https://fonts.google.com/)

### Color Scheme

Blue: - represents intelligence, responsibility, trustworthy, dependable.  It’s also relaxing and a peaceful color.
