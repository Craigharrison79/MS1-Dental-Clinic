# [Design Smile](https://craigharrison79.github.io/MS1-Dental-Clinic/)

For my first milestone project, I had to build a static responsive front end website as part of my Diploma Course with the Code Institute.
I wanted to build a website of a family member who wanted to advertise her new business through the Covid-19 times and beyond.

# UX

## Strategy

Frist I sat down with the business owner and talk about her ideas of what the website is and the information to be display on it and how it should look.  

This information is below in the [goal](#goals) section.  

Then I put myself in the position of a potential customer and wrote down a list of thing I would be looking/searching for when visiting a dentist website.  
I also ask a few friends and work colleagues on there input as potential customer, again information list below.  With all this information I start to work 
on some different [wireframes](#wireframes) on paper.

## Goals

### Owner Stories:

The owner wanted a clean and easy to read website that is useable for young and older clients. She feels it's best to use a colour pattern of different shade of 
blue's as this represent the heath service community best. See [colour](#color-scheme) scheme for more details.

#### Owner Goals:

Increase new clients to the business.
Help spread brand awareness.
Increase social following.
To pervert service information.
Pervert location and navigation to the clinic.
Pervert a way of potential and old client contact her.

### User Stories:

A user would split into two main types: 

- Someone who is looking for a dentist.
    - New Customer is then break down into a far  two more categories: 
        - New to the area.
        - Needs help with an issue.
- Existing customer. 

- #### New Customer Goals

- Needs Help?

    - To get hold of someone fast on the phone.
	- Which service they provide.
	- Testimonial and show of work. (Which at the time of building the site the owner doesn't have permit to view on the site.)

- Move to the area

	- Location of a client (close to home or work).
	- Which service they provide.
	- Testimonial and show of work. (Which at the time of building the site the owner doesn't have permit to view on the site.)
	- Contact point.
	- The look of the clinic.

- #### Existing Customer Goals

	- Need contact information to check appointment or cancelltion.
	- Find out the address or location (maybe it's a second visit).
	- Book an appointment.
	- Maybe link to any information site eg surgeons or insurance/government protocols on payment.

# Design

### Typography

I need to have a readable font that was easy for anyone to read. A font with clean lines and open and not to forcefully.  I pick ‘Roboto’ for my headings and 
then ‘Poppins’ of everything else.  Both have nice flowing lines and go well together.   I using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Color Scheme

Blue: - represents intelligence, responsibility, trustworthy, dependable.  It’s also a relaxing and a peaceful color.
