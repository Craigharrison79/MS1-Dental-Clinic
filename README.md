For my first milestone project, I had to build a static responsive front end website as part of my Diploma Course with the Code Institute.
I wanted to build a website for a family member who wanted to advertise her new business through the Covid-19 times and beyond.

# UX

## Strategy

First I sat down with the business owner and talked about her ideas of what the website is and the information to be displayed on it and how it should look.  

This information is below in the [goal](#goals) section.  

Then I put myself in the position of a potential customer and wrote down a list of things I would be looking/searching for when visiting a dentist website.  
I also asked a few friends and work colleagues on there input as potential customers, again information list below.  With all this information I start to worked
on some different [wireframes](#wireframes) on paper.

## Goals

### Owner Stories:

The owner wanted a clean and easy to read website that is useable for younger and older clients. She feels it's best to use a colour pattern of different shades of 
blue as this represents the heath service community best. See [colour](#color-scheme) scheme for more details.

#### Owner Goals:

Increase new clients to the business.
Help spread brand awareness.
Increase social media following.
To provide service information.
Pervide location and navigation to the clinic.
Pervide a way of potential and old client contacting her.

### User Stories:

A customer visiting the site is mainly looking for a dentist in the area they live or work in. This could have been  a recommendation by someone
they know or just from searching on the Internet.

- #### New Customer Goals

    - Needs Help?

        - To get hold of someone fast on the phone.
	    - Which service they provide.
	    - Testimonial and show of work. (Which at the time of building the site the owner doesn't have permit to view on the site.)

    - Move to the area

	    - Location of a client (close to home or work).
	    - Which service they provide.
	    - Testimonial and show of work. (Which at the time of building the site the owner doesn't have permit to view on the site.)
	    - Contact point.
	    - The look of the clinic.

- #### Existing Customer Goals

	- Need contact information to check appointment or cancelation.
	- Find out the address or location (maybe it's a second visit).
	- Book an appointment.
	- Maybe link to any information site eg surgeons or insurance/government protocols on payment.

## Scope

- Provide a clean and easy looking website for user.
- Provide simple and easy to follow content that will not overwhelm the user but still deliver the relevant information.
- Provide all the information for customers to ask questions and to find the location of the clinic.
- Provide the owner a way of give more interaction and the possibly to convert more people into clients.

# Design

### Wireframes

After finishing my drawing on paper, I used mockup [mockflow.com](https://www.mockflow.com/) on designing the overall idea.  Link below to the design.

 - [Wireframes Download PDF](https://github.com/Craigharrison79/MS1-Dental-Clinic/blob/master/assets/docu/website-wireframe.pdf)

### Typography

I needed to have a readable font that was easy for anyone to read. A font with clean lines and open and not to forceful.  I picked ‘Roboto’ for my headings and 
then ‘Poppins’ for everything else.  Both have nice flowing lines and they go well together.   I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Color Scheme

Blue: - represents intelligence, responsibility, trustworthyness, dependable.  It’s also a relaxing and a peaceful color.

Readable information about the color blue meaning:

    - I wanted to find a photo of someone smiling in a relaxed position.  Something that is a clean image and is offset to the right so I could display the welcome message
next to it easily.

# Testing

## Testing process can be read [here](assets/docu/testing.md).

- ## Testing User Experience and Stories (UX)

    - First time visitor goals:

        - As a first time using of the site, I wanted to understand what serivces is on offered, the main purpose of the site and how I can contact someone.  

            1. On visiting the website the customer is greeted with a easy to read website that is clean on the eye. 
            A simple navbar that is plan and easy to understand with an call to action button "Call Us"  This give the customer
            a quick and easy way to contact someone without having to search the website.

        
            2. Just below the navbar is the hero image, welcome message and also with a "Book Now" call to action button.  This call
            to action button will send the user straight to the contact page.

            3. From entering the site the user is given options to navigate the site one by navbar and two by scroll down. And two ways to 
            contact someone by one by telephone and one by email.  
    
        - As a first time visitor, I wanted the site to be easy to navigate and easy to move, to and from different section.

            1. I design the navbar to be fix to the top of the page so the user always has a recognize spot to navigate from.
         
            2. When the user click on any call to action buttons the use will be transport to the relevant section on the page.  If this is to a form then
            the site will open a "model" which keep the user at the same spot on the site and avoid any confusion about their place on the site.
         
            3. Model give a customer two ways to exit.  One to just click on the website page to return to the page or Two a cross at top of the model to click to exit. 
            This will give the user a clean way to exit and return to the site.

        - As visiting for the first time. I want to get a idea of what services are on offer,  as well as some information about the ower.

            1. As the user scroll down they will arrive on the service section where they in read about the different type of services.  On scrolling further the user will be
            able to read about the owner.

                1a. On the user reading about the owner they have a call to action book to allow the user to email about becoming a customer.

        - As a first time visitor, I want to find the location of the business.

            1. The user can naviagate using the navbar to the location section and on arrival they are greeted with the map and address.  The address once again in the footer section
            at the bottom of the page.

    - Returning customer goals:

        - As a customer returns, I want to find more information about the business, like how to interact with the business.

            1. The user can find social media in the footer which allows them to engage and keep them up to date with the going on in the business.

        - As a returning visitor, I want to have a easy way of get in contact with the business to gain further information about a particular thing.

            1. I place a call to action button "Call Us" in the navbar. This give the visitor a quick and easy way to phone the business. But when viewed on a phone,
            the call to action button will be place below the hero image and welcome message. As it is unviewable on the on a small screen view due to the toggle menu.  
            Place the button here still allows the visitor to see the button once the page has loaded.

            2. Like above there is a call to action button also in the hero image section to allow the visitor the options to email any question they may have.

            3. Also in the footer I left the email address for if someone wanted to send a email via a personal email account or if the user wanted to take it for future uses.

            4. The user can also use the navbar to location the contact section to leave a message about any question they have.
