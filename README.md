For my first milestone project I have to build a static responsive front end website as part of my Diploma Course with the Code Institute.
I wanted to build a website of a family member who wanted to advertise her business through the Covid-19 times and beyond.

## Strategy

I sat down with the business owner and talk about her ideas of the website and the information to be display on the site.  This information is below in the goal section.  
Then I put myself in the potential customer view and wrote down a list of thing I would be looking for on visiting a dentist website.  I also ask a few friend and work
colleagues on there input as potential customer, again information list below.  With all this information I start to work on some different wireframes on paper.

## Goals

### Owner Stories:

The owner want a clean and easy to read website that is useable of young and old clients. She feel the colour pattern should be a shadow of blue as this represent the heath 
service community best. See colour scheme for more details.

#### Owner Goals:

Increase new clients to the business.
Help spread brand awareness.
Increase social following.
To pervert service information.
Pervert location and navigation to the clinic.
Pervert a way of potential and old client contact her.

### User Stories:

A user would split into two main types - Someone  who is looking a dentist and an existincustomer.  

New Customer is then break down into two categories - new to the area or need help with an issue.

#### New Customer Goals

    Need Help

        - To get hold of someone fast on the phone.
		- Which service you provide.
		- Testimonial and show of work.

	Move to the area

		- Location of a client (close to home or work).
		- Which service you provide.
		- Testimonial and show of work.
		- Contact point.
		- How the clinic looks.

#### Existing Customer Goals

	Need contact information to check appointment or cancel.
	Find out the address or location (maybe the second visit).
	Book an appointment
	Maybe link to any information site eg surgeons or insurance/government protocols on payment.

## Design

### Wireframes

After finish my drawing on paper, I use mockup (https://www.mockflow.com/) on design the overall idea.  Link below to the design.
(assets)link here.

### Typography

I need to have a readable font of anyone to read. Some thing with clean lines and open and not to forcefully.  I pick ‘Roboto’ for my headings and then ‘Poppins’ of everything else.  Both have nice flowing lines and go well together.   I using Google Fonts (Link)
(https://fonts.google.com/)

### Color Scheme

Blue: - represents intelligence, responsibility, trustworthy, dependable.  It’s also relaxing and a peaceful color.  
Readable information about the color blue meaning:
