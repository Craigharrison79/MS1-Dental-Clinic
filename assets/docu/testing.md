Here is the stories of testing history....

# In the development process, the issues and solution that came up.

## Navigation issues

- **Issue:** Toggle button is not opening when click on.

    > **Solution:** I must of accidentally deleted part of the code when copying it for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/).
    I just read through and debug the code.
